# NextCharge React App

Full React frontend for the NextCharge EV charging platform, converted from the original HTML/JS.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Start the development server
npm start

# App opens at http://localhost:3000
```

## Backend Connection

The app auto-connects to the NextCharge backend at `http://localhost:5001` by default (or the URL set in `.env`).

If the backend isn't running, the app works in **demo mode** using local mock data — all UI works, login/signup show errors from the API.

To change the backend URL, edit `.env`:
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend.com/api/v1
```

Then restart the dev server.
